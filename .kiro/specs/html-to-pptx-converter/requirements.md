# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an HTML to PPTX converter application. The application will allow users to upload HTML content, convert it to a PowerPoint presentation (PPTX) format using the PptxGenJS library, and then download the generated PPTX file. This tool will enable users to quickly transform web content into presentation slides without manual recreation.

### 3. HTML to PPTX Conversion

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to convert my HTML content to PPTX format, so that I can use it as a presentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates the conversion process THEN the system SHALL use PptxGenJS to convert the HTML content to PPTX format.
2. WHEN converting HTML THEN the system SHALL preserve text formatting (bold, italic, underline, etc.) in the PPTX output.
3. WHEN converting HTML THEN the system SHALL include images from the HTML in the PPTX output if specified in the configuration.
4. WHEN converting HTML THEN the system SHALL maintain the hierarchical structure of headings as slide titles and content.
5. WHEN converting HTML THEN the system SHALL handle tables and lists appropriately in the PPTX output.
6. WHEN converting HTML with links THEN the system SHALL preserve hyperlinks in the PPTX output.
7. IF the conversion process encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the user.
8. IF the HTML contains unsupported elements THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and continue the conversion process.

### 4. PPTX Download

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download the generated PPTX file, so that I can use it for presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the conversion process completes successfully THEN the system SHALL provide a download button for the generated PPTX file.
2. WHEN the user clicks the download button THEN the system SHALL initiate the download of the PPTX file.
3. WHEN downloading the PPTX file THEN the system SHALL provide a meaningful default filename based on the original HTML content.
4. WHEN the PPTX file is downloaded THEN the system SHALL ensure the file is properly formatted and can be opened in PowerPoint.
5. IF the download fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide an option to retry.

### 5. User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can easily use the conversion tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user interacts with the application THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback on the current state of the process.
